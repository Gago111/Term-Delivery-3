    Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[36][29] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.[35][37]

Hawking attended Radlett School, an independent school in the village of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year,[37] and from September 1952, St Albans School,[22][38] an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire after Hawking passed the eleven-plus a year early.[39] The family placed a high value on education.[29] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.[40][41] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[42] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.[43] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.[44][45]

Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.[46] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.[47][48][49] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates. [50] He also wanted his son to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.[51][52]

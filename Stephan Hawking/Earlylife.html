  <p> Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[22] in Oxford to Frank (1905�1986) and Isobel Hawking (n�e Walker; 1915�2013).[23][24] His mother was Scottish.[25] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[24] The two met shortly after the beginning of the Second World War at a medical research institute where Isobel was working as a secretary and Frank was working as a medical researcher.[24][26] They lived in Highgate; but, as London was being bombed in those years, Isobel went to Oxford to give birth in greater safety.[27] Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward.[28]

In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, Hawking and his family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.[29][30] In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;[29][31] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.[29] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.[32][33] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,[34] the rest of the family spent four months in Majorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.[35]</p>
